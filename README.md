# Self-Driving-Car
Designed a Convolutional Neural architecture to avoid the need to recognise specific human-designated features, such as lane mark- ings, guard rails, or other cars, and to avoid having to create a collection of “if, then, else” rules,
based on observation of these features.
Images are fed into the CNN architecture, which predicts a steering angle as output thus piloting the car around the track.
The neural network achieves a validation accuracy of 89 percent and going beyond the norm of using CNN’s for pattern recognition
the network learns the entire processing pipeline needed to steer an automobile.
